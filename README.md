## Description

FIRE water balls to break boxes until they hit the target!

You only have 10 seconds to break all the boxes that block your way to the target!

THINK FAST!

There are three kind of boxes in the game: the paper box, the plastic box, and the plaster box. 
Each box has a different durability (took multiple hits to break) . 

I'm adding more features in the game including random reward boxes (allow you to upgrade your weapon, freeze time, fire huge bullets to break a lot of boxes at one time, etc.), explosion boxes, moving boxes, and moving targets.  I'll do more updates in the feature to add those things to the game and create more stages. If you like this idea, please stay tuned.

Hope you like this game!
